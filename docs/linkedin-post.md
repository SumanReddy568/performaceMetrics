🔍 Why Web Performance Monitoring Matters: Introducing Performance Metrics Extension

The Challenge:
• Modern web applications are becoming increasingly complex
• Poor performance directly impacts user experience and business metrics
• Traditional debugging tools don't provide comprehensive real-time insights
• Performance issues are often discovered too late in production

Who Needs This?
👩‍💻 Developers: Debug performance bottlenecks in real-time
👨‍🔬 QA Engineers: Validate performance requirements during testing
📊 Performance Engineers: Monitor and optimize web applications
🎯 Product Managers: Track performance metrics against business goals

Key Benefits for QA Teams:
1. Automated Performance Testing
   - Monitor FPS, memory leaks, and CPU usage
   - Track API response times and network performance
   - Measure page load metrics and DOM performance

2. Early Issue Detection
   - Identify performance regressions during testing
   - Catch memory leaks before they reach production
   - Monitor long tasks and layout shifts

3. Quality Metrics
   - Generate performance reports
   - Set performance baselines
   - Track improvements over time

Real-world Applications:
• E-commerce: Monitor checkout flow performance
• SaaS: Track dashboard responsiveness
• Media Sites: Measure content loading times
• Web Apps: Debug client-side performance
